## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:
 * Fixed handling of quoted values in `read_tblout`
 * Fixed warnings generated by readr
 * Fixed non-portable file paths in test suite
 * Turn off lazy file reading

## Test environments
 * local manjaro linux 5.10.49-1, R 4.2.0
 * win-builder (release and dev)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes

## Reverse dependencies

 * There are no reverse dependencies in CRAN
